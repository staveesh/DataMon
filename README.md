# DataMon

This app can be used to capture usage data from a predefined list of Android apps. The collected data can be sent to a [custom server](https://github.com/staveesh/datamon-server) for analysis.

The list of apps and the server's address can be specified in the [Config](https://github.com/staveesh/DataMon/blob/giggs/app/src/main/java/za/ac/uct/cs/videodatausageapp/Config.java) file.
